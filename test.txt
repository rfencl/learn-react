1. Java for QA Automation

Focus on writing clean, test-oriented code.
Core topics:

Object-oriented programming (classes, objects, inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism, encapsulation).

Data types, collections (List, Set, Map), and when to use each.

Exception handling (try-catch, throw/throws, custom exceptions).

Input/output (working with files, streams).

Java 8+ features (lambdas, streams, optional).

Writing reusable utilities and helper functions.

Understanding Maven or Gradle for dependency management.

Exercises:

Write a utility to read test data from a CSV or JSON file.

Implement a Page Object Model for a sample website.

Practice coding exercises on sites like LeetCode or HackerRank focusing on arrays, strings, and collections.

2. Selenium WebDriver

This will be central to web UI test automation.
Core topics:

WebDriver basics: launching browsers, locating elements (id, name, cssSelector, xpath).

Selenium waits: implicit, explicit, fluent waits.

Page Object Model (POM) and Page Factory.

Handling web elements: dropdowns, alerts, frames, windows, dynamic elements.

TestNG or JUnit integration: test suites, annotations, assertions.

Running tests in parallel and parameterizing tests.

Handling test data (data providers, external files).

Reporting (ExtentReports, Allure).

Cross-browser testing and Selenium Grid.

Exercises:

Automate a login form with valid and invalid data.

Write a script to scrape table data from a web page and validate it against expected results.

Create a reusable BaseTest class to manage setup and teardown.

3. SQL for QA

Database validation is a big part of QA automation.
Core topics:

CRUD operations: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

Joins: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL.

Filtering with WHERE, LIKE, IN, BETWEEN.

Aggregations: COUNT, SUM, AVG, GROUP BY, HAVING.

Subqueries and nested queries.

Common functions (string functions, date functions).

Writing queries to validate application data against DB records.

Exercises:

Write a query to find all users who registered in the past 30 days.

Validate that an order placed on the UI is reflected in the Orders table.

Practice combining multiple joins to test relational integrity.

4. Test Case Design

You’ll likely need to show how you think about test coverage.
Core topics:

Functional test design: positive, negative, boundary, edge cases.

Database test design: verifying CRUD operations, triggers, constraints.

Web client test design: form validation, error messages, UI consistency, navigation.

API testing basics (REST methods, JSON/XML responses).

Data-driven testing.

Exercises:

Write test cases for a login page (web client).

Write SQL test cases for a new record being added to a table.

Create an end-to-end scenario: user registers → confirm DB insert → login with new account.

5. Integration of Java + Selenium + SQL

You’ll often need to combine these skills.
Core topics:

Using JDBC in Java to connect to a database.

Querying the DB in test scripts to validate UI actions.

Designing automation tests that check both UI and DB layers.

CI/CD basics: running tests in Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab pipelines.

Exercises:

Automate placing an order in a demo web app, then validate order details in the DB.

Create a test suite that runs UI tests and DB validation together.

Write a data-driven test that pulls input from a database.

6. General QA Concepts

Don’t overlook theory questions.
Core topics:

Software testing lifecycle, defect life cycle.

Different types of testing (functional, regression, smoke, sanity, integration).

Agile methodology and QA’s role in Scrum.

Test strategy vs. test plan.

Understanding risks, prioritization, and coverage.

7. Mock Interview Practice

Simulate interview conditions:

Write and explain test cases verbally.

Solve a SQL query on a whiteboard or in a shared doc.

Debug a small Selenium script.

Explain trade-offs in framework design (e.g., why Page Object Model, why TestNG).
